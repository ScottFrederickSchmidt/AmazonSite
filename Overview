# This webpage is designed to look like Amazon.com using Datatables API:  https://datatables-ecom.000webhostapp.com/
# The webpage runs on Javascript, PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, AJAX, and J-Query.
# The site is able to add new items to cart, delete items, or make changes.
# All code is safe from SQLI injections. 
# The site adapts to work on phones, ipads, and computers. 
# All HTML and CSS is compliant with HTML5 validator.
# The site can also add new items to sell with a second Database. 
# The website can reflect new information by updating without having to update the entire webpage.
# One of the last updates was making a recommendations section. This could become more powerful with AWS API.


# Room for improvements:
# I never made a complex login system due to the fact that most of that is already encripted anyway.
# Clearly, I never added a payment system as that would be unethical. My site already accidentaly got taken down by Google because they 
# thought it was a "scam" site. On a real site, I would use Stripe or Paypall for payment for secruity reasons.

# Note: Not all code is within the Github files for security and confidential reasons. 
# I also soon plan on making a YouTube video showing the site in a more detailed showing.
